StuffNearMe is an app that helps you find whatever you're looking for! Whether it be a restaurant, train station, or any other type of establishment, StuffNearMe will help you! StuffNearMe also supports custom queries, and allows for searches either from the user's current location or any particular address. 

StuffNearMe queries Google Places and finds establishments fitting your search description and displays them in a table. At that point, the user has the option of selecting one of the table cells to display a map showing that location and the user's starting location, or to see all of the results on a single map. Tapping any map annotation will bring you to the details page for that place, where you can find things like address, phone number, and a portal to the iOS Maps application to get directions suited for walking, driving, biking, or public transportation.

StuffNearMe also allows the user to store favorite addresses (Home, Work, etc., to name a few) and holds recent queries as well so that the user can conveniently reference and use them.

On the About page, there is a link where users can email suggestions for future features. 

Enjoy!
